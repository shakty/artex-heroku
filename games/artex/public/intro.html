        The experiment is divided in two
        parts: <strong>Preparation</strong> and <strong>Game</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <h3>Part 1: Preparation</h3>
        
        In Part 1 you will <strong>not</strong> interact with other players,
        and you <em>cannot</em> earn points unless esplicitely
        mentioned in the screen. Part 1 involves three steps:
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            First, some basic <strong>psychological and
            demographics</strong> characteristics will be collected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secondly, the <strong>instructions</strong> of the game
            played in Part 2 will be shown to you, followed by a short
            understanding <strong>quiz</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, you will play in <strong>practice mode</strong>
            to get familiar with the game interface.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <h3>Part 2: Game</h3>
        
        In this part you will interact with <strong>other human</strong>
        participants. You might need to wait until enough participants
        are connected, but the waiting time should be short and up to
        just a few minutes.
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            The game will be repeated for a certain number
            of <strong>rounds</strong>, and each round you will have a
            chance to <strong>earn points</strong> based on your
            actions and decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the game, you will be shown
            a <strong>questionnaire</strong> consisting in a short
            compulsory part followed by a series of optional
            questions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Payout scheme</h3>
        
        The total sum of points collected during the experiment will
        be transformed in USD with the exchange rate 1000 : 1 and paid
        to you as a bonus.
      </p>
